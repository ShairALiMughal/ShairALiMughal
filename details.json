Spread over the entire raised ground of this semi-detached Victorian townhouse, you are in one of Forest Hill's most desirable spots. As you walk into the property to your right this the large open plan lounge superb for entertaining and still being apart of the conversation with its sizeable breakfast bar. Further on with views over the gardens is the second bedroom which is still a great size that could easily house a king size bed, excellent for siblings or friends buying together. Following on in the hallway you have your well kept bathroom and then finally you have master bedroom with blissful views over the rear gardens.<br /></p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">The location is fantastic as your nearest station is only 0.3 miles away which is - Forest Hill for trains to London Bridge some can do the walk in under 3 minutes - Why don't you time yourself?</p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">Forest hills connectivity is superb bringing you into London Bridge, Canada Water, Highbury & Islington and Dalston. Buses are a plenty on London Road and there are new eateries popping up every month! Sainsbury's is only a stone throw away. For great beers and Sunday lunches, I would have to recommend the The Signal which is nice and close for those evenings where you've had a little too much but equally is not that close!</p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">For further eateries, parks, green areas and retail opportunities you have East & West Dulwich (and well-loved Lordship Lane) is but a 10 minute walk, however in less than a minute's walk you are in central Forest Hill and all it has to offer. Green space? The Horniman Gardens is seriously close for a walk or a kick-about especially on a Saturday when there is a Farmer's Market. Sydenham Hill Wood, Mayow Park, Crystal Palace and the fabulous Dulwich Park are all easily reached - all within a 10 minute drive.</p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">Ground Rent - Â£10 PA</p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">Service Charge - Â£527.04 PA</p><p style=\\\"font-size:16px\\\">Lease Length - 96+ Years Remain</p>",

                        "description": "<div><div><p><strong>Architecture & Interior</strong></p><p>Thereâs a zen-like experience that starts from the moment you close the solid warehouse style front door behind you. Every light-filled floor of the open plan interior is a minimally styled contrast to the rugged industrial appearance outside.</p><p>The heart of this creative home is arguably the vast studio workshop on the ground floor. With over 700 sq ft of open space and generous ceiling heights that peak around 11ft, thereâs more than enough room to ease into your artistic stride. Crisp, white painted walls and a matt-grey poured-concrete floor promote a sense of calm and serenity.</p><p>An oversized set of industrial doors at the front of the studioâs raised & tiled floor area spill out onto the mews allowing easy loading and unloading of large works.</p><p>Above the studioâs far wall, a trio of large velux windows fills the roof void at the base of an exterior light well, providing an enormous amount of sunshine (when it decides to put in an appearance).</p><p>A huge sliding wall in the middle of the studio reveals some ingenious design touches. Three bespoke mobile work pods are stationed behind and, with minimal fuss, can be rolled out, unfolded and used for all manner of artisanal projects. And when no longer required, these clever pods just fold up and wheel back into storage, allowing the room to transform into a gallery space for private or public enjoyment.</p><p>A guest WC and wet room are found via the door on the upper tier of the studio.</p><p>Thoughtful design and consideration continues on the first floor. Three bedrooms are connected by a central hallway with two walls of wardrobes, bespoke book shelving, and an integrated utility room housing the washing machine and more bespoke joinery.</p><p>The shower room and WC at the end of the hall is another bright room with a window into the light well that casts the sun over shiny white floor & half tiled walls.</p><p>A show-stopping reception room on the top floor is exceptionally finished. Warm timber flooring complements the kitchen that occupies one side of the open-plan space where a corian countertop with inbuilt induction hob and sink sits above elm-clad units housing a selection of high end integrated appliances.</p><p><strong>Outside</strong></p><p>Beefy bi-fold doors at the rear of the reception open out onto a very surprisingly serene, decked roof terrace with plenty of privacy that catches the afternoon sun.</p><p><strong>In The neighbourhood</strong></p><p>The shopping in Forest Hill is a good mixture of independent shops, post office, cafes and restaurants alongside a large Sainsburyâs supermarket. Close by are the excellent swimming and gym facilities ofÂ Forest Hill Pools, not to mention one of Londonâs favourite museums, The Horniman. This free-to-visit Victorian masterpiece is a wonderful local treasure, and alongside permanent collections and regular exhibitions of natural history and world culture, the lovely gardens and excellent cafe are very fine places to enjoy. Forest Hill is also ready to enjoy its Cinema again at the ornate Capitol Cinema just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Â Transport & Connections</strong></p><p>There are excellent transport links from Forest Hill station with Southern and Overground services offering a collection of direct trains to London Bridge, London Victoria, Highbury & Islington, Whitechapel and Shoreditch heading towards the centre of the city, or Croydon and Crystal Palace to the south. Multiple bus routes connect neighbouring boroughs including Dulwich, Lewisham and Sydenham.</p><p>Â </p><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>* Property construction: Traditional Brick<br /> * Utilities: Gas, Electricity, Water Supply, Broadband<br /> * Gas Supply: Independently supplied.

                        "description": "<br /><br />Located in the heart of Forest Hill in South East London, this amazing property is one of few left of this style in London affording an excellent opportunity for those seeking to create a live/work space to entirely their own specification and design.<br /><br />Built in 1860, the building is set in a cobbled mews famed for its artists and creative community. Presently home to sculptor David Mach, this is a huge warehouse conversion set over two floors offering approximately 4500 sq ft of live/work space currently arranged as the artist's studio and open plan living accommodation.<br /><br />The roof terrace above offers a further 2250 sq ft of garden space decked and planted with mature palm trees with views to the Horniman Gardens in the North West and Woolwich to the East. The position of the roof traps the sun all day in a private outdoor space.<br /><br />A potential buyer should be aware that plans exist for a further 1280sq feet of living space within the roof terrace, planning permission having been granted in 2003. Permission has expired awaiting the potential of further application.<br /><br />The Victorian brick building was converted over 15 years ago offering a gallery/workshop layout on the ground floor and a two bedroom apartment on the first floor. The property is little changed since and boasts the original wooden floors, a new large and entirely unique working fire place designed by the artist and a soundproof studio. The first floor is extremely well lit with three large skylights and windows running the length of the building with a balcony opening out onto the street. The ground floor is used as the artist's studio and for storage.<br /><br />Forest Hill itself is interestingly situated. Only 12 minutes away by train to London Bridge, the new Overground service also providing links to the Underground via the Jubilee line. Forest Hill station is only two minutes away from the building making it easy to get to the City and Gatwick airports. It has become a very popular area with plenty of good independent cafÃ©s, restaurants and pubs and has a new swimming pool and leisure centre. The area is significantly green and pleasant, the building being minutes away from the Horniman Museum and its gardens and a short walk to Dulwich Park.<br /><br />Opportunities to buy a property with this versatility are very rare. Don't miss out on the chance to live in this wonderful building in this stunning location.<br /><br /><br />Council Tax Band: C (London Borough of Lewisham)<br />Tenure: Freehold<br />Council tax Â£1,615 per annum",

                        "description": "Superb Three Bedroom Coach-House Conversion With Balcony.<br /><br />Originally a coach-house to a nearby stately home, this magnificent period conversion plays host to the perfect marriage of quirky original charm and contemporary elegance. Spread over three lovely floors, the accommodation comprises a huge open plan living, dining and kitchen area (perfect for easy-living and lavish dinner parties), fancy shower room, second reception/movie room and three ample double bedrooms. One of the bedrooms enjoys access to a sunny decked balcony whilst the master is ensuite and leads to your pretty paved patio garden. The house feels wonderfully self-contained behind high wooden gates. It's peaceful, private and perfectly presented. Your nearest station is Forest Hill for trains to London Bridge - a mere 3 minute walk. The London Overground line supplies an impressive connectivity to the tube network and easy peasy access to Canada Water, Highbury & Islington and Dalston.<br /><br />The handsome exterior, with original London stock brickwork, sits behind high wooden gates affording peace and privacy. Opening to a split-level triangular patio (with seamless wooden storage) you can choose to enter the house via a main door on your left or indeed wide bi-fold glass doors straight ahead. The living space stretches the full impressive width of the property and rises to double height with light cascading down through a lofty vaulted skylight. Wide wooden flooring runs vertically the full length of the space. <br /><br />There's generous lounging, dining and entertaining space. The kitchen runs along the right-hand wall with solid oak counters atop smart navy cabinets. Appliances include an integrated dishwasher and super seven-ring gas range and there's a lovely double sink. Further floor to ceiling glass doors lead rear to your cute L-shaped patio garden which boasts raised planters and a peaceful vibe. The first of your double bedrooms sits off the living area with tonnes of slumber and storage space. Another set of bi-fold glass doors open to the garden - lovely for a morning coffee! There's an adjoining ensuite bathroom with gorgeous roll-top bath and period loo, cistern and wash hand basin. The floor tiles are dishy and there's a skylight above for illumination and ventilation. <br /><br />To the rear of the living space you find a most-attractive shower room with gorgeous green tiling, brass fixtures and a large walk-in shower with mottled glass screen with drencher fitting. The lower ground floor living space offers a fine symmetrical room - perfect for working from home, yoga, teenage hideaway or home cinema! Heading up your insatiably bright and wide staircase you'll note a sublime curling hardwood handrail. The landing area allows you preside over the living space. It's airy and light and has space for shelving. Bedroom two is a peaceful double with fab vaulted ceiling, original wooden beams and slick grey walls. Across the landing you find bedroom three with much the same charm and wide double doors opening to a fantastic balcony. <br /><br />Buses are a plenty on London Road and there are new eateries popping up every month! Sainsbury's is only a 1 minute walk. The Signal (formerly The Hobb) is moments away on this road too, ideal for Sunday lunch! For further eating and retail opportunities, fabulous East Dulwich (and well-loved Lordship Lane) is but a 10 minute walk, however in less than a minute's walk you are in central Forest Hill and all it has to offer. Green space? The Horniman Gardens is seriously close for a walk or a kick-about especially on a Saturday when there is a Farmer's Market. Sydenham Hill Wood, Mayow Park, Crystal Palace and the fabulous Dulwich Park are all easily reached - all within a 10 minute drive.<br /><br />Tenure: Freehold <br /><br />Council Tax Band: E<br /><br />",

                        "description": "The property is a four-storey semi-detached building internally altered to form five self-contained flats situated on a large corner plot. Â The five flats comprises of 1 x 3 bed, 2 x 2 bed, 2 x 1 bed along with a large communal garden. We believe the garden maybe viable for further planning opportunities (Subject to relevant consents).\\r<br />\\r<br />The flats are all tenanted and are on short-term tenancies. The property currently generates an income of Â£63,900 per annum and we believe based on local comparable searches that the flats maybe under-rented. Â The property can be sold with vacant possession.\\r<br />\\r<br />The property is situated in the London Borough of Lewisham. Â It is a short walk from the Forest Hill Train station (0.3 miles). This station provides direct access to London Bridge in 20 minutes. In addition, the local High Street is a short walk away with plenty of amenities nearby including the Horiman Museum and Dulwich Park.\\r<br />\\r<br />The A205 is situated directly outside the property which offers direct access into Richmond and Greenwich. The A23 runs on the western part of the property which which offers direct access into Surrey and Central London. There are multiple bus routes nearby including the 176 which offer connectivity to the rest of South London.\\r<br />\\r<br />Gatwick Airport is 60 minutes drive and is accessible via the M23. Heathrow Airport is 65 minutes drive away and is accessible via M4. Â ",

Its beautiful array of grand period properties located on either side of a tree-lined street make it the address of choice for many a resident. For the lucky residents that happen to live on the road, the benefits include a short stroll down the hill to reach Forest Hill Station (where there is access to the Overground and Southern services) or a short stroll up the hill to reach Horniman Museum & Gardens. Meanwhile, Sainsburys and a variety of independent shops and eateries line London Road just south-west of Manor Mount.</p><p>Towards the top of the hill sits a grand Victorian building that was converted into 9 modern apartments. Each property benefits from a well-run block and access to the large communal south-westerly facing rear garden. Located on the top floor sits this impressive 1,250 sq ft flat. Internally, the property comprises 2 sprawling double bedrooms (one with an ensuite bathroom), an open plan kitchen/reception room (extending 33â), the main bathroom and an external storage cupboard.</p><p>Tenure: Leasehold (115 years remaining) Service Charge: Â£250pm Ground Rent: Â£250pa</p><p></p><br /><br />",

                        "description": "Found within Forest Hill's inimitable Taymount Grange, this studio apartment has a pared-back finish that allows the building's 1930s bones to sit centre stage. Immaculate communal gardens and allotments surround the entire estate, with the best of Forest Hill - including great coffee spots and the enchanting Horniman Museum and Gardens - just a short walk away.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Building\\r<br />\\r<br />Taymount Grange was designed by George Bertram Carter and built between 1935 and 1936; inside, its lifts and richly carpeted stairwells hint at the glamour of the building's early life, when facilities available to occupants included a dining room and lounge. It has a caretaker, an intercom system for access, and plenty of bike storage. Its communal areas are in great condition and retain many of its original features. Expansive lawns surround the building and are home to well-planted allotments, which residents have private access to. For more information on Taymount Grange, please see the History section below.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Tour\\r<br />\\r<br />The apartment lies on the lower ground floor, yet remains exceptionally bright care of the carefully sloped topography of the communal gardens beyond; Crittall windows look out directly onto a section of this gently inclining greenery. It occupies a compact plan, with a bedroom/living room, kitchen and bathroom, connected by a central hallway with a built-in wardrobe for storage.\\r<br />\\r<br />The living/bedroom occupies the right-hand side of the plan, with the bed neatly concealed behind a white curtain. There is high-level storage above and a run of built-in bookshelves by the doorway. Crittall windows look out to a path and the emerging greenery of the communal gardens beyond.\\r<br />\\r<br />In the middle of the plan is the kitchen, which also functions as a dining area. It also serves a third purpose, with the built-in banquette seating and fold-down dining table at the rear wall coming together to create a single bed when required. The kitchen itself has ample storage in white cabinetry, solid oak worktops and a generous fridge/freezer. Tongue-and-groove panelling adds a traditional touch, and a large window has the same views towards the gardens.\\r<br />\\r<br />Adjacent is a good-sized bathroom, home to a large bath and the original Crittall windows, here frosted for privacy.\\r<br />\\r<br />Outdoor Space\\r<br />\\r<br />All residents of Taymount Grange enjoy the use of communal gardens to the front and rear of the building. These tranquil spaces include a shared barbecue area and established allotments with a variety of fruit trees and a natural wildlife area.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Area\\r<br />\\r<br />Taymount Grange is located close to the Horniman Museum and Gardens. It's well-placed for the shops and restaurants of Dulwich Village and East Dulwich, as well as the open spaces of Sydenham Woods and Dulwich Park. Local highlights include Bona, Pantry, and Aga's Little Deli, while St David serves excellent coffee.\\r<br />\\r<br />All of the amenities of Forest Hill, including its railway station, are approximately five minutes away on foot. Regular trains run from Forest Hill to London Bridge, with a journey time of 12 minutes. The station is also a part of the London Overground, with services running to Dalston via Canada Water (Jubilee Line), Shadwell (DLR), Shoreditch High Street and Whitechapel (District, Hammersmith & City and Elizabeth Lines).\\r<br />\\r<br />Tenure: Leasehold\\r<br />Lease Length: Approx. 110 years remaining\\r<br />Service Charge: Approx.

                        "description": "Found within Forest Hill's inimitable Taymount Grange, this studio apartment has a pared-back finish that allows the building's 1930s bones to sit centre stage. Immaculate communal gardens and allotments surround the entire estate, with the best of Forest Hill - including great coffee spots and the enchanting Horniman Museum and Gardens - just a short walk away.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Building\\r<br />\\r<br />Taymount Grange was designed by George Bertram Carter and built between 1935 and 1936; inside, its lifts and richly carpeted stairwells hint at the glamour of the building's early life, when facilities available to occupants included a dining room and lounge. It has a caretaker, an intercom system for access, and plenty of bike storage. Its communal areas are in great condition and retain many of its original features. Expansive lawns surround the building and are home to well-planted allotments, which residents have private access to. For more information on Taymount Grange, please see the History section below.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Tour\\r<br />\\r<br />The apartment lies on the lower ground floor, yet remains exceptionally bright care of the carefully sloped topography of the communal gardens beyond; Crittall windows look out directly onto a section of this gently inclining greenery. It occupies a compact plan, with a bedroom/living room, kitchen and bathroom, connected by a central hallway with a built-in wardrobe for storage.\\r<br />\\r<br />The living/bedroom occupies the right-hand side of the plan, with the bed neatly concealed behind a white curtain. There is high-level storage above and a run of built-in bookshelves by the doorway. Crittall windows look out to a path and the emerging greenery of the communal gardens beyond.\\r<br />\\r<br />In the middle of the plan is the kitchen, which also functions as a dining area. It also serves a third purpose, with the built-in banquette seating and fold-down dining table at the rear wall coming together to create a single bed when required. The kitchen itself has ample storage in white cabinetry, solid oak worktops and a generous fridge/freezer. Tongue-and-groove panelling adds a traditional touch, and a large window has the same views towards the gardens.\\r<br />\\r<br />Adjacent is a good-sized bathroom, home to a large bath and the original Crittall windows, here frosted for privacy.\\r<br />\\r<br />Outdoor Space\\r<br />\\r<br />All residents of Taymount Grange enjoy the use of communal gardens to the front and rear of the building. These tranquil spaces include a shared barbecue area and established allotments with a variety of fruit trees and a natural wildlife area.\\r<br />\\r<br />The Area\\r<br />\\r<br />Taymount Grange is located close to the Horniman Museum and Gardens. It's well-placed for the shops and restaurants of Dulwich Village and East Dulwich, as well as the open spaces of Sydenham Woods and Dulwich Park. Local highlights include Bona, Pantry, and Aga's Little Deli, while St David serves excellent coffee.\\r<br />\\r<br />All of the amenities of Forest Hill, including its railway station, are approximately five minutes away on foot. Regular trains run from Forest Hill to London Bridge, with a journey time of 12 minutes. The station is also a part of the London Overground, with services running to Dalston via Canada Water (Jubilee Line), Shadwell (DLR), Shoreditch High Street and Whitechapel (District, Hammersmith & City and Elizabeth Lines).\\r<br />\\r<br />Tenure: Leasehold\\r<br />Lease Length: Approx. 110 years remaining\\r<br />Service Charge: Approx. Â£2,000 per annum\\r<br />Ground Rent: Approx. Â£100 per annum\\r<br />Council Tax Band: A",

                        "description": "<p>Manor Mount is often the first name on the list of most desirable roads to live on in Forest Hill. Its beautiful array of grand period properties located on either side of a tree-lined street make it the address of choice for many a resident. For the lucky residents that happen to live on the road, the benefits include a short stroll down the hill to reach Forest Hill Station (where there is access to the Overground and Southern services) or a short stroll up the hill to reach Horniman Museum & Gardens. Meanwhile, Sainsburys and a variety of independent shops and eateries line London Road just south-west of Manor Mount.</p><p>Towards the top of the hill sits a grand Victorian building that was converted into 9 modern apartments. Each property benefits from a well-run block and access to the large communal south-westerly facing rear garden. Located on the top floor sits this impressive 1,250 sq ft flat. Internally, the property comprises 2 sprawling double bedrooms (one with an ensuite bathroom), an open plan kitchen/reception room (extending 33â), the main bathroom and an external storage cupboard.</p><p><strong>Available NOW Unfurnished Council Tax: Lewisham Band E</strong></p><br /><br />",

                        "description": "The Development\\r<br />Â \\r<br />Dartmouth Place is a row of contemporary townhouses located just off Dartmouth Road, a short walk from Forest Hill station. Newly converted and modernised, the development consists of five stylish houses, with three bedrooms and the opportunity to customise with a study or fourth bedroom.\\r<br />Â \\r<br />The houses are styled with a soft Scandinavian inspired palette to provide calm neutral interiors and monochrome accents to finish. Each house is fitted with matt reed green kitchens and quartz worktops, integrated high spec Bosch appliances, European oak engineered wood flooring, bespoke panelling and designer lighting.\\r<br />Â \\r<br />The Location\\r<br />Â \\r<br />Forest Hill is a desirable and well connected area in South East London, considered the âcultural quarterâ of Lewisham and popular with artists, creatives, families and young professionals alike. The Horniman Museum in Forest Hill was recently voted Art Fund Museum of the year. It is made up of 16 acres of grounds and hosts the Horniman Saturday morning Farmers market.\\r<br />Â \\r<br />There are many popular greenspaces nearby; Horniman Gardens and Park, Devonshire Road Nature Reserve, Sydenham Hill Wood, Dulwich Park and Dacres Wood Nature Reserve. There are a broad range of shops, independent cafes, gastro pubs and restaurants minutes from the property, a state of the art leisure centre, whilst also benefitting from close proximity to outstanding local schools and several of south Londonâs celebrated âvillages:â Dulwich Village, East Dulwich, Crystal Palace and Sydenham.\\r<br />Â \\r<br />This three/ four bedroom end of terraced house measures approximately 1,284 sq ft. The ground floor contains a large entrance hallway along with several storage cupboards and either one or two bedrooms (dependent on your choice of layout), one with an en-suite. There is also access out into the private garden. The first floor contains an additional bedroom and the family bathroom. The bathrooms are finished to a high specification with Hans Grohe hardware and Vitra matt vanity units. The living/kitchen/dining area occupies the whole top floor, with the kitchen having matt green handless cabinetry with Bosch (or equivalent) built in appliances and white quartz worktops. There is a private balcony that is accessed from the top floor. Every house has access to an additional communal garden for the wider development. There is also Off-street parking.\\r<br />Â \\r<br />NB: Images are CGI's and provide a guide to the finished product and likeness can't be guaranteed.\\r<br />\\r<br />EPC: C Council Tax Band: C Offered Unfurnished Available mid December HD: Â£865.38 SD: Â£4,326.92",
